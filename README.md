# Gateway Fees Plugin for WHMCS

Version: **1.0.2**

This is an open-source fork version of the (Original) Gateway Fees plugin for WHMCS, https://github.com/ajarmoszuk/WHMCS-Gateway-Fees (now closed)

It will allow you to set percentage fees or set prices for payment gateway modules in WHMCS. For example, if you want to pass on a 3% credit card fe back to the customer, you can do so.  Please note that some countries / payment providers do not permit the "on charge" of their fee to the end customer..... 

To install this addon module, upload the **gateway_fees** directory to **/modules/addons/**.

Go to Setup -> Addon Modules, active and configure price ($ and/or % per transaction).

Your activated payment gateways will be automaticly shown there. You can set fixed fee or/and some percent of the total.

NO SUPPORT - USE AS IS
